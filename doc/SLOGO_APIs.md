# SLogo API Design Lab Discussion
### Judy He, Jason Qiu, Jordan Haytaian, Jeremyah Flowers
### TEAM #3


## Planning Questions

 * What behaviors (methods) should the Turtle have and what service should it provide?

 * When does parsing need to take place and what does it need to start properly?

 * What is the result of parsing (not the details of the algorithm) and who receives it?

 * When are errors detected and how are they reported?

 * What do different commands need to know, when do they know it, and how do they get it?

 * What behaviors does the result of a command need to have to be used by the View?Â 

 * How is the View updated after a command has completed execution?

 * What value would Controller(s) have in mediating between the Model and View?
 


## APIs
 
### Model/Backend External API

 * Goals
   * To allow the View to animate the turtle by inputting a distance or angle and receiving the final position or facing position without needing to understand any implementation details.
 
 * Contract 
   * All classes related to turtle animation will assume that the command is parsed and the distance or angle is passed in if turtle moves forward or turns.
   * All classes related to turtle animation will collaborate to update the turtle's position or heading. 

 * Services
   * Return the animation window's bounds, graphics scaling factor, turtle object
   * Return the turtle's current position, initial postion, heading, step history
   * Return the turtle's heading towards a given position
   * Perform a step on turtle, step forward and backward in a turtle's step history, reset the turtle's position adn heading 


### View/Frontend External API

 * Goals
   * To handle UI interactions and queries such as loads, saves, animation speed, pen colors
   * To display internal date when requested, Splash Screen, GUI, etc.
   
 * Contract
   * All classes related to display will assume that the data is parsed and passed INTO the class.
   * All classes related to interactions will assume the data needs to be handled and SENT
 
 * Services
   * Methods to display/show window, page, turtle animation, buttons, etc.
   * Provides an interface the user can communication with.
   * Passes internal information to be processed/handled

### Model/Backend Internal API

 * Goals
   * To perform all math operations for updating the turtle's position and heading based on the commands received.
   * To keep track of the history of steps taken by the turtle for efficient animation replay, speeding up the animation, and stepping forward or backward in the animation history. 
 
 * Contract
   * All classes related to turtle animation will assume that the turtle's motion can be represented by interactions between position and vectors and that each turtle step represent a corresponding postion/vector operation.
   * All classes related to turtle animation will collaborate to calculate the turtle's new position or heading.

 * Services
   * move and rotate turtle
   * check if turtle in bound after a step
   * calculate angle, magnitude, x and y components of vectors
   * calculate dot product and cross product of vectors
   * calculate final postion given distance and initial position or facing postion given angle and initial position.

### View/Frontend Internal API

 * Goals
   * To handle user queries, take information, and pass that information to be displayed.
   * To handle XML configurations, errors, and pass exceptions.

 * Contract
   * All classes related to the internal API assume that the data will be processed before being 
     sent to the external API.
   * All classes related to the internal API assume that any data that is needed is to be passed 
     from the backend (or an XML file).
 
 * Services
   * Pass data to be displayed
   * Parse data
   * Pass config 
   * Handle query (or button)
   * Handle error
   * Pass exception

### Use Cases

#### Example Use Cases: [Java File](plan/usecases/ExampleUseCases.java)
 * The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail, and has the command added to the environment's history.

 * The user types '50 fd' in the command window and sees an error message that the command was not formatted correctly.

 * The user types 'pu fd 50 pd fd 50' in the command window and sees the turtle move twice (once without a trail and once with a trail).

 * The user changes the color of the environment's background.

#### Judy He: [Java File](plan/usecases/JudyUseCases.java)
1. SLOGO 76, 77: The user clicks on replay animation and sees the animation resets and reruns its previous series of commands.
2. SLOGO 75, 77: The user clicks on step back in the animation and sees the animation go back one command.
3. SLOGO 75, 77: The user clicks on step forward in the animation when there is no more commands in the turtle's step history.
4. SLOGO 74-77: The user clicks on clear animation and sees the turtle position resets and the drawing clears.
